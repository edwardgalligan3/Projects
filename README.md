## Titanic Exploratory Data Analytics, Machine Learning Model Tuning and Evaluations

This work spawned from the legendary Kaggle - Titanic competition. The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on the dataset provided. This workbook provides data wrangling, feature engineering, model comparisons and selection with alternative approaches compared along the way.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 68% of the passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. Specifically, the women, children and upper-class passengers.

This exercise is a supervised learning classification problem.
Supervised learning describes a type of problem that involves using a model to learn a mapping between input examples and the target variable.

Models are fit on training data comprised of inputs and outputs and used to make predictions on test sets where only the inputs are provided and the outputs from the model are compared to the withheld target variables and used to estimate the skill of the model.

Learning is a search through the space of possible hypotheses for one that will perform well, even on new examples beyond the training set. To measure the accuracy of a hypothesis we give it a test set of examples that are distinct from the training set.
