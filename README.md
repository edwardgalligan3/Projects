## Titanic Exploratory Data Analytics, Machine Learning Model Tuning and Evaluations

This work spawned from the legendary Kaggle - Titanic competition. The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on the dataset provided. This workbook provides data wrangling, feature engineering, model comparisons and selection with alternative approaches compared along the way.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 68% of the passengers and crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. Specifically, the women, children and upper-class passengers.

The Jupyter notebook as well as a pdf file of the notebook have been loaded. Enjoy!
